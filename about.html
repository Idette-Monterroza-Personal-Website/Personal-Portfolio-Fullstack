            <p class="hobby-p"> Drawing has always been one of my favorite hobbies! I don't do it as much as I like, but when I start drawing again it's always an inspiring time. My drawing skills have improved
                but not enough where I can draw hands! I believe once you can draw hands, you can draw anything. Hands are always a challenge for artists! </p>

            <h3> Gaming </h3>
            <div class="hobbys">
                <img class="hobby-icon" src="about-icons/gaming-icon.png">
                <p class="hobby-p">Gaming will always hold a special place in my heart. I've been gaming since elementary school and my favorite Nintendo console was the Gamecube and Gameboy. The games that were 
                    on those consoles were some of the best! In college I joined the eSports Club where I played Overwatch Competitively. It was a great time. Nowadays, most of my gaming is on my PC where I play games like
                    Stardew Valley, Phasmophobia, and The Binding of Isaac. </p>

            <img class="hobby-icon" src="about-icons/ramen-icon.png">
            <p class="hobby-p"> I love eating! The best feelings in life, besides sleeping is eating one of your favorite foods. There are so many flavors in the world. I have always been in love with chicken parmesan, ramen and my mom's enchiladas verdes!</p>
